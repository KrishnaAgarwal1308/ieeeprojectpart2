This is a old project of mine which i have just uploded cause i never completed it since i was feeling really laze to do it and had other interesting ideas to work on.
I only implemented the login and jwt auth in this along with owner page and the login page of the e-commerce website.
there are many scrap images lying around in this repo which were supposed to be different items in the site.


# to run this 
```
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaAgarwal1308/ieeeprojectpart2

npx nodemon .\app.js
```
